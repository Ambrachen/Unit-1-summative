                You got me second guessing everything
                You mess me up
                You mess me up
                Smoking away all the pain
                I'm rolling up
                I'm rolling up
                
                I'm taking shots to drown these memories
                I'm drowning now
                I'm drowning now
                I shoulda never gave you the key
                To my soul, yeah
                
                I wanna be your lover
                Don't wanna be your friend
                Wish we could be forever
                But I know
                THIS AIN'T IT
                
                For now, I'll be stuck in this beautiful nightmare
                'Til you come back, I'll be standing right here
                Do I ever cross your mind?
                
                You used to be something like a beautiful daisy
                But now you're like a rose with your thorns how you hurt me
                Do I ever cross your mind?
                Anymore
                
                Used to be lovers now we enemies
                You mess me up
                You mess me up
                There really ain't much left that I could say
                I'm rolling up
                I'm rolling up
                
                I need some medicine to numb the pain
                I'm drowning now
                I'm drowning now
                I shoulda never gave you the key
                To my soul, yeah
                
                I wanna be your lover
                Don't wanna be your friend
                Wish we could be forever

                Do you ever
                Dream about us together?
                
                Do you ever
                Want forever?
