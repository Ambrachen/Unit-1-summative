                My life's been magic seems fantastic
                I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress
                It's funny when you want it
                Suddenly you have it
                You find out that your gold's just plastic
                
                Every day every night
                I've been thinking back on you and I
                Every day every night
                
                I worked my whole life
                Just to get right just to be like
                Look at me, I'm never coming down
                
                I worked my whole life
                Just to get high just to realize
                Everything I need is on the
                Everything I need is on the ground
                On the ground
                Everything I need is on the ground
                
                Nah but they don't hear me though
                (Yeah what goes up it must come down)
                Nah but they don't hear me though
                (You're running out of time)
                
                My world's been hectic seems electric
                But I've been waking up with your voice in my head
                And I'm trying to send a message
                And let you know that every single minute
                I'm without you, I regret it
                
                Every day every night
                I've been thinking back on you and I
                Every day every night
                
                I worked my whole life
                Just to get right just to be like
                Look at me, I'm never coming down
                I worked my whole life
                Just to get high just to realize
                Everything I need is on the
                Everything I need is on the ground
                On the ground
                Everything I need is on the ground
                
                Nah but they don't hear me though
                (Yeah what goes up it must come down)
                Nah but they don't hear me though
                (You're running out of time)
                
                I'm way up in the clouds
                And they say I've made it now
                But I figured it out
                Everything I need is on the ground
                
                Just drove by your house
                So far from you now
                But I figured it out
                Everything I need is on the
                Everything I need is on the ground
                On the ground
                Everything I need is on the ground
                Nah but they don't hear me though
                
                On the ground
                Nah but they don't hear me though
                Everything I need is on the ground
