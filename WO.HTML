My eyes are closed
No, they are open, but I can't see
The piercing light so bright
I try to cover my eyes with the palms of my hands
But it's no use
Cold water slaps against my cheek
And for the first time I see
The noonday sun that refuses shade
And the midday sea that gives it all away
Is a welcome and a warning
Now we stand in front of the most fantastic island in the world
You can take anything you want, but nothing is free
The most precious things might be the things you have to give away
In order to get the treasure
We've either got to get through a brooding monster
Or a swirling tornado
Whatever we choose, we've got to run
What do you think?
