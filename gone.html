                I thought that you'd remember, but it seems that you forgot
                It's hard for me to blame you when you were already lost
                Oh, yeah
                I'm tired of always waiting
                Oh, yeah, yeah
                I see you changed your number, that's why you don't get my calls
                I gave you all of me, now you don't wanna be involved
                Oh, yeah, yeah
                I really gotta face it
                Oh, yeah, yeah
                
                I just wanna be the one
                But to you we're already done
                Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?
                Now I'm all alone, crying ugly
                You broke my heart just for fun
                Took my love and just left me numb
                Now it's eight in the morning
                Hate in the morning (All because of you)
                
                Another story that's sad and true
                I can feel the pain, can you?
                You had to be the one to let me down to color me blue
                Hate to see you with someone new
                I'll put a curse on her and you
                Ain't no looking back, now you're dead and gone
                My love is gone too
                
                All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
                All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
                All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
                All my love is gone
                Now you're dead and gone
                
                All my love is gone and the hate has grown
                Standing all alone
                And I'm searching for something
                But I can't feel nothing
                I pack my bags and go
                This don't feel like home
                Too much darkness for a rainbow
                I feel so used
                How am I supposed to live without you? I refuse (Yeah)
                
                I just wanna be the one
                But to you we're already done
                Tell me, why'd you have to hit and run me?
                Now I'm all alone, crying ugly
                You broke my heart just for fun
                Took my love and just left me numb
                Now it's eight in the morning
                Hate in the morning (All because of you)
                
                Another story that's sad and true

                Ain't no looking back, now you're dead and gone
                My love is gone too
                
                All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
                All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
                All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-ne
                All my love is gone
                Now you're dead and gone
